I am a customer coming to your company. I am writing to report what happened between me and your attendant when I parked my car at your company on October 31.

On October 31, the weather is very cold, my colleagues and I will have a meeting in your company building with the personnel in charge of the launch of Chang 'e I satellite, and we will discuss the final step of the orbital integration plan. When we arrived at your company's intelligent parking lot, the warden asked us to put the car on the conveyor belt and then let us off. But when he got off the bus, he didn't tell us that the car would be taken to the garage immediately, nor did he remind us to bring our belongings with us. As it was our first time to park in this modern parking lot, we had no experience and no knowledge of the parking procedure. As a result, we got out of the car without our jackets and laptops, and the car had been transported away. We began to negotiate with him, pleading with him to bring the car over, because the important information for the meeting was on the laptop. He just wouldn't return the car, and he was very nasty, swearing at us for not getting out of the car and taking our things with us. After bargaining with him for about half an hour, he finally agreed to return the car on condition that we pay a one-time pickup fee. We agreed to his request in order to get the computer and clothes in time. We were 20 minutes late for the meeting that day, and we caught a severe cold, which has not been recovered, and the treatment cost was as high as 800 yuan.

For his behavior, we are very angry, in the report of the Seventeenth National Congress, especially emphasis on people-oriented, building a harmonious socialist society, he as a parking manager.Should serve the people wholeheartedly, but his service attitude is extremely bad.There should have been an obligation to inform consumers in advance, but he didn't; Should have actively assisted to solve the problem after the work error, but he did not actively assist to solve the problem. Instead, he comes to blame us, wasting our precious time and damaging our health. It also damages your company's good image among consumers.

This thing for me is a small thing, but if he does not correct his attitude to work, happen to every parking people, it is a big deal, the 2008 Olympic Games will be, such things happen again, will affect the image of our country in the international. So I strongly request your company to carry on the profound criticism education to this person, and compensates our medical treatment expense and the spirit loss expense 3000 yuan whole.
